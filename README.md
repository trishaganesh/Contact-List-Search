# Contact List Search
This program performs searches within a contact list.

Binary and sequential search. We are to create a contact list array of 10 objects, 
storing values such as name, relationship, birthday, phone number, and email.

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I struggled to understand how these concepts can be put together in one large program. 
This program had several parts and I needed to write the pseudocode.  

What I liked: 
I enjoyed working with the searching techniques. 
I will be sure to revisit these concepts in the future.
